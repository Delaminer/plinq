This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

To build the extension, run ```npm run build```.
**Note:** This also builds the Next.JS output, which is not needed if you are developing the pure extension. If you do not need to build the Next JS server, you can then instead use ```npm run build-fast```.

The built folder is ```extension_out```. In Chrome Extensions, Select "Load Unpacked" and select that folder.
